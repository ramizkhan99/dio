# Do-it-Ourself (DIO)
_Not to sure about this title :P_


## Idea

This project is been built to bring together people who want to work on an idea together.

It is mainly meant for 3 types of people -
- Who have an idea and want to work on it together with others
- Who have an idea but do not have the skillset to go forward with it
- Who are looking for motivation to work on something new

Devs would have the option to make posts about project updates.
Form a DevLog allowing viewers to discuss and motivate creators with likes and comments.

As project advances, contracts between creators and freelancing can be added as well.
